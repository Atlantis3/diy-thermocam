**Firmware Updater**

To flash the newest version of the firmware to the DIY-Thermocam, use the Teensy Loader that works on Windows, Linux and Mac**. **

For Windows, it is available in this folder, for Linux and Mac download "Teensyduino" from [here](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.htm). Load the hex file with "teensy.exe", then launch "teensy_reboot.exe" while the Thermocam is connected to the PC and turned on. The flash procedure should start. 

In the unlikely case that the update failed and the device **does not start any more**, press the push button on the Teensy to put it into bootloader mode, then try to flash again.
