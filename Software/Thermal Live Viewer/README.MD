# Thermal Live Viewer

This application allows you to connect to your DIY-Thermocam from a PC over the USB serial protocol and stream live thermal images. 

It only works under Windows. You need to make sure that your Thermocam is listed as COM10, see [this guide how to change it](http://plugable.com/2011/07/04/how-to-change-the-com-port-for-a-usb-serial-adapter-on-windows-7/).
