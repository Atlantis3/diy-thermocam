# DIY-Thermocam - Thermal Live Viewer

This Python application allows you to connect to your DIY-Thermocam from a PC over the USB serial protocol and stream live thermal images. Run the main.py and change the comport for the device to work.

The Video Recording relies on FFMPEG and does currently only work under Windows.
