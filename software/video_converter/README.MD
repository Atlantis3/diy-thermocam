# DIY-Thermocam - Video Converter

This video converter allows you to convert a whole folder containing bitmap frames from a video or timelapse capture into a movie file.

You can either convert the raw data files to bitmaps on the device, or use the thermal data viewer together with the batch export function to do so (faster).
